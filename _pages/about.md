Abdullah was born in Karaman in July 1997. He lived the first two years of his life in Erzincan and turned back to his hometown which is Karaman. He was interested in math and computer since he was a child.

Abdullah spent his free time with computers and the amazing world of math. He graduated from "Karaman Fen Lisesi" in 2015. 

After high school, he started to study computer engineering at ITU. Since he has a lot of interest in robotics and electronics, he began studying Control and Automation Engineering as a second major in 2018. However, as a choice, he decided to continue his education in computer engineering and dropped the second major. He was studying in the field of Artificial Intelligence, Reinforcement Learning, and Robotics. The graduation project, titled "Robotic Manipulation with Tools in Kitchen Environment", for the computer engineering degree was in these fields. 

After his bachelor's degree, he started master’s in ITU. During his master’s, he worked mainly on uncertainty, calibration, and continual learning. He graduated with a thesis titled "Memory-based Approaches to Problems in Probabilistic Modeling" in 2022.

Now, Abdullah is a PhD student at the University of Southern Denmark.
